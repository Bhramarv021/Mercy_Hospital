Introduction
Physiotherapy is a health profession concerned with helping to restore well-being to people following injury, pain or disability.

The elderly have diseases and disorders in greater numbers than any other age group; their care is difficult, but rewarding. In JGH Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation Services' Geriatric rehabilitation programme focuses on the concerns the physical disabilities of the senior citizens. The process of ageing is often complicated by several physical conditions and disorders like arthritis, osteoporosis, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, hip and joint replacement, balance disorders, incontinence and so on.
