Human heart works tirelessly throughout your life. It is your power bank which never pauses to rest. Heart diseases have increased rapidly in the recent years and show warning signs similar to other medical conditions like chest pain, shortness of breath, heaviness & burning sensation in chest, palpitations, nausea, weakness, fatigue, sweating and pain in shoulders or arms. One should never take these danger signs lightly and immediately consult your doctor for diagnosis & treatment. The Department of Cardiac Sciences at Jaipur Golden Hospital provides advanced and comprehensive care to patients with routine heart problems to most complex and rare ones.
